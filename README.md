# Memo game
## How to play:
Download or clone the repository and click on 'index.html'.
As soon as you refresh the browser the game begins:
* click on a card and try to find the corrisponding symbol
* Getting the wrong couple will make you lose a star
* Matching two cards will make you gain a star
* If you lose all the stars you lose the game
* The 'restart' button will restart the game, timer and star rating
* Game over? No problem: 'play again' button will also restart the game

Folder content:
* index.html, where the basic view is stored
* css/app.css, where the game style is stored
* js/app.js, where the engine is stored
